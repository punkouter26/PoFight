Web game Stack: React/Next.js + .NET 10 API(Azure Static Web Site / Azure API)
Initial development:  Client only with no server / Use client solutions for saving data like high scores
Use .NET API Server for initial data fetching (leaderboards, player profiles) and Client Components only for the interactive game loop Once I have integration the .NET API project into the solution
Do not require the .NET backend to run / If API is offline/not created, then just disable server functionality
